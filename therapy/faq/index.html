			<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>

				<p><i>Who do you work with?</i> I work with adult individuals and couples who are curious to dive deep into the work of being present with themsleves. I think everyone brings a particular beauty to the world. </p>

				<p><i>What do you specialize in?</i> I specialize in couples therapy, spiritual & religious trauma, and life transitions. I draw on several psychotherapeutic techniques, but find the locus of my therapeutic approach to center in our relationship. While primarily focused on existential/meaning making concerns, I also incorporate behavior focused treatment and psychoeducation (e.g family systems theory) into my therapeutic approach.</p>

						<p>When working with couples, I draw on Emotionally Focused Therapy principles to help couples communicate at the level of feeling instead of frustration.</p>

						<p>It's deeply troubling when somethign we percived as good causes so much harm. I work with people who have experienced religious or spiritual abuse, helping them heal from evil masquerading as good. </p>

						<p>Navigating transitions is difficult. Whether you're navigating a transition to retirement, establishing a career in a new place, or discovering yourself after ending a toxic relationship, I work to help you find meaning, purpose, and your own desire in whatever hardship you're facing.

						<p>In all of my work, I attend to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23992445-the-wild-edge-of-sorrow">the wild edge of sorrow.</a> </p>

				<p><i>How much do you charge?</i> I charge $140 for individual 50 minute psychotherapy sessions. For couples, I charge $175 for a 50 minute session. I also offer monthly rates.</p>

				<p><i>Do you take insurance?</i> I am not paneled with any insurance providers. However, I can issue you a superbill (a monthly receipt) that you can submit to your insurance provider for out of network reimbursement. Please check with your insurance provider to learn their policy regarding superbills.</p>

				<p><i>Where will we meet?</i> I am currently seeing clients online through telehealth. And in-person in Silverdale, WA.</p>

				<p><i>What's your liscense number?</i> I have a Mental Health Councelor Associate License with the state of Washington (MC61288169).</p>
