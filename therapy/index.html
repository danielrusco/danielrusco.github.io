			<h3>How I Approach Therapy</h3>

				<p>I primarily approach therapy from a relational, psychodynamic framework, informed by attachment theory, object relations, and neuroscience. Simply put, I believe that our relationships shape us, wound us, and heal us. The "Big T" and "little t" traumas we've suffered impact the way we relate to others and to ourselves. Therapy is a place where we explore how we've been shaped, grieve the pain & loss we've suffered, and try on new ways of relating to ourselves and others. </p>

				<p>I approach therapy collaboratively. Consequently, I value honesty in our relationship. I invite you to say the things you might not want to say. Our relationship is a place where it’s okay to bring things that don’t have space in other relationships. This allows us to explore together and bring voice and meaning to your feelings and experience, thus allowing you to be more you. </p>

				<p>I strive to understand my clients holistically, and therefore attend to the biological, psychological, social/relational, and spiritual aspects of my client’s situations.</p>

				<p>My practice is rooted in the here & now relationship between client and therapist. I seek to bring awareness to what is taking place between the client and myself, both as a means of understanding learned relational patterns and as an invitation to practice new ways of relating.</p>

				<p>My work is trauma informed, meaning I believe that our experiences of unmetabolized harm profoundly shape how we are in relation to others. I seek to provide a space where my clients can bring normally overwhelming feelings. Together, we work to better understand and make meaning from their experiences. I also incorporate mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, and creative expression into my practice. </p>
