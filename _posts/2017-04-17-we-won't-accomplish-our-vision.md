title: "We won't accomplish our vision, and here's why."

*Note: This post was written in the spring of 2017, before TSHTF. Some things have changed. Some things have stayed the same.*

Yes, that is a very bold statement. I get it.

**It's time we reevaluate our vision.**

We're four years into this thing. It's high time we do a little evaluation. It's easy to look at what we're doing today and affirmatively answer the question, "are we changing the way Tulsa sees God?" We've grown from 35 to 235 in our short life. We have more Ethos Groups and more people in those groups than ever before. Our Sunday volunteer teams largely operate like a well oiled machine. There's a lot going and it's all going pretty well. No doubt we've failed along the way and at times have experienced some rather uncomfortable growing pains, but buy and large we've done well. Quite well. However those things are just the surface. I fear there is tension building beneath the surface: competing visions applying pressure against each other like tectonic plates along a fault line.

From my perspective, there is some inconsistency about what is at the core of our vision. To understand the root of this inconsistency it's important that we know the origin of our vision statement. Did you know our vision has not always been to change the way Tulsa sees God?

In the first few month's of Ethos' existence, back when we were still meeting in the youth room at Christ Presbyterian, Beau, MaryBeth Johnson and I sat around a table in the RiverOaks childcare area to brainstorm a t-shirt design. We wanted the logo on the front and a catchy phrase explaining what we were about on the back. After throwing out a few ideas, we eventually settled on "Changing the way Tulsa thinks about God." Our vision statement came from a 30 minute t-shirt design meeting with children playing in the next room.

Back when we were just a small group at RiverOaks, Beau approached me about his church plant: Ethos Presbyterian Church. I went over to his house one afternoon and he walked me through a PowerPoint presentation outlining the vision of his church plant. It was going to be a place that pared passionate worship with deep theological teaching. In a city where several churches have one or the other, the vision was to be a church that had both. Beau's vision came from years of living in a city full of churches with either head or heart.
It is important to understand these two stories, because in them you can begin to see an inconsistency that drives current unrest in our organization. One vision is for a city. The other for a church. Along our journey the two visions have played off each other and at times have even been confused for each other. However I fear we may be approaching a time when those two visions begin to war against each other. In the long run, if we are to successfully bring in the Kingdom of God with as much effect as possible, we need to settle on one or the other.

For the sake of this paper I assume that our vision is to change the way Tulsa sees God. It is a bolder vision and can include a church with solid teaching and passionate worship. I also believe it is closer to the purpose of the Church universal and therefore the heart of God.
Without vision the people perish.

Let's take a minute to recognize what's at stake. If we are successful at changing the way Tulsa sees God, thousands of people will come to know Jesus. People in our city will feast on the fruits of the Spirit. Businessmen and women will be better bosses and leaders. Parents will raise better children. Depressed people will be given hope. Relationships will be restored. Blind people will see.

If we are not successful, we will be just another church in a city full of churches. We might use people to further our own kingdom. We'll see people leave. Thousands will miss out on the goodness of the Gospel. And most tragically, our city will remain a city full of people with misconceptions about God.

**Strategy, tactics, and battlefield command.**

In order to understand why I believe we won't accomplish our vision, we need to take a look at our current strategy. Yes, we want to "change the way Tulsa sees God - or "understands" or "thinks about" or sometimes both; we're not consistent. But how? What change are we trying to affect?
What is our current strategy?

Simply put, our current strategy is growth. We believe that size is the number one factor in changing our city. Size establishes relevance, which builds credibility, which gives us a platform for our message. Our current growth tactics are to buy a building and hire a worship leader. We think that having a space and improving the quality of our service will attract more people and give us a foothold in the city of Tulsa. While these two tactics alleviate current pressure points (i.e. a lack of space and a burnt out volunteer leader) I believe they will only provide medium range results. Yes, having a building will induce growth, and improving our worship might keep people coming back, but what will we do once we've accomplished these two tasks? Are they simply "magic bullets" that will pierce through all future challenges?

**What sort of change are we trying to accomplish?**

The answer to this question should drive all of what we do at Ethos. Without a clear answer we "get tackled by Sunday's-a-coming busyness, we get distracted by the next how-to-church book, and we stay addicted to "done-for-you" resources" (Mancini et al, 2016, loc. 308). Without a clear picture of what we are trying to create, we will default to growth or quality as our end game.

Will Mancini says of growth related visions, "a healthy bias toward growth can lead us unintentionally to substitute a grow-only vision for a growth-minded vision.… Keep in mind that "growing bigger" is not a compelling vision for the people who attend your church. And today more than ever, you can't expect people to salute its generic form. Bigger can be viewed as prideful. Bigger can be spun as egotistic. Bigger can be viewed as less personal, less meaningful, and less caring" (Mancini et al. 2016, loc. 826). Perhaps of more note is the fact that growth in and of itself is incredibly uninspiring. If all we talk about is a new building, campus, or attendance number our people will quickly grow tired of "growth" and look for a place that articulates and practices a more substantive vision.

Just as growth is an uninspiring vision, a generic "we're the best" vision is equally uninspiring. Too many churches look to previously successful churches to simply copy-and-paste a model of success to their organization. They see Hillsong, Acts 29, or Sovereign Grace and try to imitate their success. Mancini notes that this strategy is "elusive at best and hollow at worst" (Mancini et al, 2016, loc. 906). How can you ever know when you've achieved success? Simply being the best not only runs the risk of sounding prideful, it also offers no real substance. We ought to be careful as we tell our story of "passionate worship and deep theology" that the narrative stays far away from a "we're the best because we we have it all".

Rev. Ricky Jones argues that churches only really need a 2–5 year plan. While that may be the case for most churches, most churches don't have a vision as bold as ours. Changing the ethos of an entire city is an audacious undertaking. It is important that we understand that change on a city-wide scale takes either 1) events of cataclysmic proportion or 2) a long time. If we are to effectively change the way Tulsa sees God, we need to adopt a long-term approach or capitalize on any future watersheds in Tulsa history.

As I understand it, our long-term strategy is to grow and plant more churches and keep growing and planting and growing and planting. We want to be a network of Ethos churches, spread across the city. But how will we ever get there? While it is important that we formulate a tactical plan for future growth (e.g. when, where, who, etc.), *I believe it is more important that we create a model for the type of change we want to affect, as this change has been and will be the primary driver of growth.* Our long-term approach should apply not only to the structure of our organization but also to the hearts of our people.

**What captivates the heart?**

A definition of where God is leading us (i.e. our vision for change) needs to be equally corporate and personal. It needs to be larger than all of us and relevant to each of us. We all long to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. We all also long for personal gain. Martin Luther King Jr's dream for racial equality included his children. Toussaint Louverture who lead the Haitian revolution was a slave himself. If our vision is to the scale that I believe it is, we need to articulate the type of change we seek in a way that insights action on a corporate level as well as an individual level. This requires we move from a generic "change" centered vision to something more personal yet equally as bold.

Growth is never the inception of growth. Change is. A goal for change that resonates in the hearts of our people will in turn drive growth. So what are we changing? Where is God leading us? What is the heart of God for the city of Tulsa?

Without a clear understanding of the type of change we are trying to affect accomplishing our vision becomes merely a wish. And just as "growing bigger" is not a compelling vision, a "change the world" vision is too generic and leaves people lacking inspiration. However before we sit down and hash what we are trying to accomplish, there are a few assumptions and cultural expectations we need to address.

**Always aim just in front of the duck.**

We currently operate with the assumption that only large churches in Tulsa are relevant. While that may be the case today, it is rapidly changing. The current generation of influencers in Tulsa likely go to established churches in the downtown area, however the next generation of influencers are dropping out of church. As I said earlier, change takes time. If we want to actually change the way Tulsa sees God, we've got to target the next generation of influencers. So who are the next generation and how do we reach them? If we fail to accurately answer these questions, we will fail at our vision to change the way Tulsa sees God.
For the church to successfully carry out the great commission, we will always need to target the next generation. The generational question is a perpetual question that invites us to use our imaginations to join in God's work of creating his Kingdom here on earth. This sort of generational thinking is near to the heart of God.

**So how do we effectively reach the next generation?**

There's plenty of research on millennials. We're willing to pay more for something if we're buying from a company with a cause. We're also over twice as likely to be early adopters. New things don't scare us. We're also creators. If we don't like the way you do something, we'll go do it better ourselves. We're redefining the rules of business and creating entire new industries.

Millennials don't like cookie-cutter. If given the choice between Mom & Pop's Restaurant and Applebee's, we will pick Mom & Pop every time. We'll look past your purple hair and tattoos to the core of your message. *And if we like it, we might just dye our hair purple too.*

If we are to reach millennials, it's vital that we exude authenticity. If we say we want to change the way Tulsa sees God, we'd better have answers to their questions about what sort of change we're after. And more importantly we've got to passionately pursue that change or be dismissed as phonies.

**Too big to succeed.**

The strategy of getting big to becoming relevant will not work on millennials. We're dropping out of church because we don't trust the establishment. We see megachurches spending thousands upon thousands on themselves and patting themselves on the back after a few hours at the food bank and are disgusted. So what do we trust? We trust real. If we successfully reach millennials we will do so because of the authenticity of our message, not because of our quality or size.

Our primary focus must be the people. Not growing to a certain size. Not being the best at what we do. Our focus must be the the hearts and lives of the next generation. We want to be taught, listened to, corrected, encouraged and commissioned. We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves, yet equally as personally affected because of it. *We want the Gospel, most of us just don't know it yet.*

So what does putting people first look like? Externally it looks like doing difficult things in our city. It looks like building up our ministries of mercy to extend beyond our doors and continuing to invest in our neighborhood through things like Kids Hope USA. Internally it looks like nurturing people's talents instead of using them up. It looks like giving people opportunities and then letting them try again when they fail. It looks like getting into the mess of a divorce or the trauma of a family's miscarriage.

Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't grow or plan for growth. Our vision actually supposes growth! To fail to plan for growth would be foolish. *However, growth shouldn't be a tactic. It should be an indicator of success.* If we are changing the way Tulsa sees God, we will grow. So yes, let's grow! But let's do so because we're changing lives. Let's grow because our people are spiritually vital. Let's do so because we bring the relational restoration we have in Christ to our city. Let's grow because our story is one of redemption and restoration.

**Your story is our story is God's story.**

The greatest tool we have to change the way Tulsa sees God is story. It's the story of the gospel to be specific. Why is story so important and how will it help us change the ethos of an entire city?
Narrative gives meaning. The Gospel is an excellent example of how this works. The story of the Bible - creation, fall, redemption, and restoration - gives meaning to our existence as beings. It is within this story that we rightly understand who we are and where we are going. Even when we try to assign a different meaning our purpose to our existence, we do so through narrative. Ancient mythologies told stories about gods to explain everything from weather patterns to worship practices. If we are trying to reach a generation who long for their story to have meaning and purpose, there's no better way to reach them than through the use of story. Viewing our own stories within the context of the story of the Gospel pairs corporate movement with personal relevance.

Story is universal. It doesn't just appeal to millennials yearning for significance. Cavemen told pictorial stories on the walls of caves and businesswomen continue their favorite Netflix show after a long day's work. John Eldridge notes the transcendence of stories and our innate desire to be a part of something larger than ourselves when he says:
>In the postmodern era all we have left is our small stories. It's not Pentecost; it's time for spring training. Our role models are movie stars and the biggest taste of transcendence is the opening of ski season. Our best expressions are on the level of "have a nice day." The only reminder we have of a story beyond our own is the evening news, an arbitrary collection of scenes and images without any bigger picture in which they fit. The central belief of our times is that there is no story, nothing hangs together; we all have bits and pieces, the random days of our lives. Tragedy still brings us to tears and heroism still lifts our hearts, but there is no context to any of it. . . . Our heart is made to live in a larger story; having lost that, we do the best we can by developing our own smaller dramas. Look at the things people get caught up in: sports, politics, soap operas, rock bands. Desperate for something larger to give our lives transcendence, we try to lose ourselves in the smallest kind of stories. (as cited in Mancini et al, 2016, loc. 1101)

The story we tell must call us people to something greater than ourselves. We all yearn to be a part of a story greater than our own. The wonderful news is that the Gospel is that story! Our vision for Tulsa should invite people to lose themselves in the story of the Gospel. To simply call people to be a part of the biggest, best, or most influential church in Tulsa invites people to be a part of a small kind of story. We must invite people to a story greater than one church or a network or churches in Tulsa. We must invite people to the story of the Gospel, as it is the only story that satisfies and the only story that endures.
How do we use narrative to cast vision and capture the hearts of a generation? We tell the story of where God is leading us and invite people to be a part of that story. Our story is God's story.

**A call to action.**

I hope by now you see that we have much work to do! We need to do some deep reflection and take a look at the Ebenezers of our story. Where has God brought us? And who has he brought us? What are the particulars of our redemption? Once we take a look at where we've been, the work of imagination can begin! We can start to master plan the change our city so desperately needs.

Once we know where we're going, or more specifically who we are changing into, we can tell that story and watch in amazement as the narrative of the Gospel unfolds before our eyes.
