We are surrounded by a cacophony of voices demanding that we produce more, weigh less, get low, and stay high. These voices promise the world, but are really like drinking saltwater. The thirst only grows. The more you have, the more you have to have. Good enough is never enough.

Evil says that our identity comes from the things that we have, the things that we do, and what people think about us. And that is not untrue. However it is not a complete or ultimate truth. The things that we have and do as well as what people say about us do shape us. If we let them, we can lose ourselves to them. However there is something more true and whole than the promises of Evil.

When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, Evil looked him in the face and promised the world. Turn these stones into bread and what you do will be enough. Throw yourself off the top of the temple and when your angels catch you, people will speak well of you. I'll give you this entire kingdom and when you have it all, life will be good. Just say yes.

It's easy to say yes to the promises of Evil. You might say it's our default setting. And if we're honest, it's even easy to say yes to Evil in the name of Jesus. If I give my tithe regularly, God will like me. If I serve the church faithfully, I'll be enough for Jesus. If I keep my name clean, my fellow christians will respect me.

The tragedy of this way of thinking is that it is solely focused on the self. It gives no room for God. Ultimately this boot strap way of life is a life without the perfect love of a father. It's lonely and exhausting, like running up a down escalator that only turns faster the closer you are to the top.

When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, God the Father made a pronouncement about his son. He said, "this is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." This was before Jesus' ministry. God didn't say, "this is my Son, who killed it the past three years. Attaboy!" or "this is my Son, who is going to have the biggest ministry the world has ever seen!" or "this is my Son, who's going to have more more followers than Beyonce." He called him beloved. God's pronouncement is one of intrinsic delight. God delighted in Jesus before Jesus could prove himself, and in so doing gave Jesus an identity that is more true and fulfilling than the promises of Evil.

This truth is an ultimate truth. When our identity comes not from externals like what we have, what we do, or what people say about us, but from the very Word of God, we are not tossed to and fro by the ever changing waters of our culture. We don't have to live exhausted lives, reaching for the Next or trying to prove ourselves. We can rest in the delight of our Father.

There was a man named Henri Nouwen who was well respected as an academic in the faith community. He wrote books, taught at prestigious seminaries, and lived a life in strict devotion to God. In a very religiously clean way, he was defined by what he did, what he didn't have as a celibate priest, and what people thought about him. In his later years he served at a community for adults with intellectual disabilities. The first few weeks Henri served at L'Arche he was responsible for a man named Adam. Adam relied on Henri for his every need. Everyday tasks like bathing or eating lunch took hours, and in those hours a special bond formed between Henri and Adam. Henri found that if he was drawn away from Adam for a speaking engagement, he missed him. Just being with Adam was a delight. The man who could give Henri nothing, gave Henri a new understanding of what it means to be beloved.

Trying to understand Adam's life through God's eyes, Henri wrote the following.
> > Long, very long, before I gave Adam to his parents, long before he was born among his fellow human beings, I knew him and loved him. He belonged to me as my beloved child. I carried him from all eternity in my heart and mind and cared for him as for the apple of my eye. Then one day I sent him to the planet earth to live among people. Because he would be a man invited to suffer, I entrusted him to a loving woman and a caring man who were to be his parents. I sent him to be a silent witness who would bring my message of love through his great vulnerability. I know that few people are capable of fully accepting a gift hidden in brokenness. Therefore, I chose with great care these two people so that they could help me in revealing that gift to the world. For thirty-four years Adam lived among his brothers and sisters. He was not able to speak, walk without assistance, go regularly to school, find a job, earn a living, or have a wife and children. He didn't give talks, write books, or win a prize. He simply was present among people as a silent witness to my love. Then, on February 13, 1996, I saw that Adam had fulfilled his mission and I called him back home to me. I gave him a voice so he could tell me all he had experienced on the earth and in a body that would allow him to walk, run, and dance in my presence to everyone's delight. I am so glad to have him back, and I know for sure that having been where he was, he will give special attention to all who loved him and cared for him but also to all the people whose brokenness he shared.

It is so easy to forget God' perspective of our life; to forget that we are loved by Him in a way that is beyond our understanding. It's easy to forget that what God says about us is more true that the voice of Evil.

You, dear child of God, are beloved of God. You are more than what you have, what you do, or what people say about you, because you have been adopted into the family of God and have a Father who delights in you just as he does His Son. The beauty and depth of delight in your story is more than you know.
May you live today resting in the love and delight of your Father.
